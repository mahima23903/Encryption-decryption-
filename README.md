# Encryption-decryption-
Performing encryption &amp; decryption using AES. 

A sample Data set of bank transactions is considered, preprocessed, iterated and encrypted.
We use AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) for encryption after the data is encoded. 
A symmetric Cipher is used, that is, using the same key for encryption and decryption.
The key is a sequence of random bytes that is generated.
The data after encryption and key are stored in different binary files for safer access.
